Tetris game

The game starts on a rectangular board called a tetrion or matrix. 
During the game, blocks consisting of four small squares, also known as blocks, appear in the middle of the top edge of the board.
These blocks (referred to as "tetrimino") travel towards the bottom edge as much as possible.
The player's task is to arrange the tetrimino on the board (by using rotation and moving the blocks horizontally) in such a way that the squares that make up them form a row across the width of the rectangle.
When this happens, this row is deleted and the remaining blocks drop to the bottom, creating more space for the next items.
